# JavaScript Objects Lab

## Overview

In this lab, we'll create objects and perform various operations on them. 

## Instructions

Be sure to run the tests to get a feel for the types of problems this lab is
asking you to solve. In particular, you'll need to define a `recipes` object and
then apply certain updates (destructively and non-destructively) in various
functions.
